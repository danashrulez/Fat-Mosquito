# Fat-Mosquito
A simple godot game I made for GameOff 2021 (first time making a game)

Hi, this game was made in godot. I have added all the codes and scenes as well. It's written in GD Script. I have also added all the assets used.
All the pixel art as well as the original music I made for the game. I have just skipped a couple of files like the mosquito sound
and the slap sound effect which I took from opensources with CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication - Licensing from freesound.org

Thanks for checking out this project :)
